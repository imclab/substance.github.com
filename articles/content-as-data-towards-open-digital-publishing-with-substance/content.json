In this little essay, I’d like to sketch the challenges that modern publishing systems face today. I’d also like to come up with ideas for how the complexity can be handled with the help of specialized user-driven software. With Substance, our team is implementing the proposed ideas, not only to verify their feasability but also to release a crowd-funded open source publishing system as a modern alternative to existing publishing solutions."
